If one boy was out of the question...two, well, two was absolutely out of the question!  Life has a funny way of working out just as it should.  As I was making plans to have my first litter our youngest child was having a very difficult time in school.  It was in this time that my husband and I really pushed for further testing.  Our youngest was diagnosed with ASD as well as SPD and an anxiety disorder.  This young dog has been our child's constant companion since before he opened his eyes.  I kept him under the pretense that I would decide which of the two boys to keep however, it was obvious from very early on that he had made up his mind and so had my daughter.

Galen finished his ASCA championship in 5 weekends out under Senior Breeder Judges and AKC judges alike.  He has done well in the show ring, but the thing he loves to do most of all is be at home with his girl.  Though Galen only lacked a few points to finish his AKC championship, we made the decision to neuter him so he could continue with his favorite activity of taking care of his kid.![DSC_0046 (1)](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dsc_0046-1.jpg)![IMG_4108](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_4108.jpg)![10522369_10203651039092655_2050757310586111229_o](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/10522369_10203651039092655_2050757310586111229_o.jpg)![img_3655_med-3](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_3655_med-3.jpeg)![img_2128_med](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_2128_med.jpeg)![AthenaGalen](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/athenagalen.jpg)![img_2678_med-2](https://samwiseaussies.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_2678_med-2.jpeg)
