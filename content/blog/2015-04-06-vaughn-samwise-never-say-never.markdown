Vaughn is named Never Say Never because I never wanted to keep a boy, but here he is... and boy what boy he is.  This funny, bright, loving dog is surpassing my dreams on a daily basis.  Vaughn is a comedian, but when it is time to get down to work he will work.  I am loving his zest for life and drive to please.  He is a clean moving dog with ground covering side gait.  I am proud of many things about this young boy, but the thing I am most proud of is his wonderful temperament.  He is confident, yet gentle.  Kind, but not a push over.    We are embarking on many first adventures together and it is my complete honor to have this young man at the end of my leash.  To say I adore him is an understatement.

Watch for Vaughn in the AKC and ASCA specials ring in 2018

Standing to approved bitches on a limited basis.  For more information on Vaughn's availability you can email me at samwiseaussies@gmail.com
