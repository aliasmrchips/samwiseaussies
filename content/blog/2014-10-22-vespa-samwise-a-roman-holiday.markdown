This beautiful girl has rejoined us here at Samwise and I could not be more thrilled.  Vespa is co-owned with my good friend Lacey Kafter of [Citabria Aussies](http://citabriaaussies.weebly.com).   Stay tuned for an update on this beautiful girl, she lacks one major to finish her AKC championship, which she will be working on this spring.
