When choosing to breed Jude a second time several things factored into my decision.  First, I was extremely pleased with the first litter she produced.  Second, the precious little girl I was looking for in the first litter turned out to be a boy.  Given how nice our first cross was, Bravo was the natural choice for my second litter.  The anticipation of puppies is both painful and exhilarating.  When Jude finally started into labor on the morning of Dec. 20, 2014 I could hardly wait to see who would be joining us.  My personal wish list for a girl was basically a carbon copy of Jude with a few improvements.  No one ever gets exactly what they are wishing for so I modified it to a structurally sound girl.  Right before midnight on Dec. 20, 2015 Jude gifted me with her doppelgänger.  I watched this girl grow with anticipation.  She was mine from the moment she got here, just like her mother.




 Lorelei has followed in her older brother's footsteps and has more than exceeded my expectations .  Her second weekend out in ASCA she was RWB to the major and her third weekend out she picked up 2 major wins toward her ASCA championship.  Her first weekend out in AKC she won a very competitive BBX class and was strongly considered for winners.




We will be focusing on Lorelei's AKC championship this year with plans to breed her for her first litter at the end of 2018.  Watch for this stunner in the ring.
