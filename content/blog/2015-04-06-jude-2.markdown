Here is our story...




When Jude was 2 ½ weeks old I drove over to Lubbock for the Heart of the Plains AKC show to meet up with Kate, Linda, Danielle and Vicki and David Telles.  We were going to show dogs, celebrate Kate's birthday and see cute baby puppies.  On the evening we went to Linda's to visit puppies we all sat around the whelping box and took turns holding the babies.  One of the girls was just fussy.  She complained about everyone and then she got to me.  This beautiful, fat little creature tucked herself into my shoulder, right up against my neck, sighed the biggest sigh and fell asleep.  I called Mark that evening saying I was so happy the puppies were spoken for because I would be begging for that puppy.




Kate had this wonderful habit of emailing videos of puppies as they grew.  I loved watching the videos.  When the litter was between 7 and 8 weeks old I responded back to one of these emails and casually made the comment that I sure did love Joss (Jude's litter name) and it was a shame she was taken already because I would love to have her.  Kate replied asking me if I was serious, which I was.  It turned out that Jude was very recently available...the rest, as they say, is history.




Jude is absolutely stunning, she finished both her championships completely owner handled with wins in ASCA under SBJ and AKC judges alike.  Her mind is every bit as wonderful.  I love her work ethic but most of all I love her.  She still tucks herself up against me and sighs that sweet sigh and my heart melts every single time.  In the fall of 2013 Jude (bred to Bravo- HOF BIS ASCA/CKC/AKC Gr Ch. Hearthside's Standing Ovation CGC TDI DNA-VP ROMX-I) blessed me with 7 beautiful babies for Samwise Australian Shepherd's first litter.  She raised them beautifully and a little over a year later we repeated the cross for Jude's second and final litter.




Now my wonderful, perfect girl will continue her job as keeper of the house and best friend.
